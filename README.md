PROJECT BRIEF

I created this website according to the following brief: 

You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The client has asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. The client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts. During testing, you will use your own account that you create to act as the owner.
You may create your own fictional client for this project, with a theme, backstory and branding of your choosing.
